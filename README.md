# spelling
A simple spelling application to help my kids(and eventually other kids) with spelling

Why Spelling?
=============

It is an easy thing to do to help kids learn.

What are my goals with it?
==========================

Bring kids, parents, and educators together.

Future?
=======

Add other things to help kids learn, like math and reading.  But I think the key is parent and teacher involvement.  Also I think that competition is good, so why not have weekly competitive objectives?  See how kids from around the country(world maybe?) compete?

Want to contribute?
===================

Fork the project, add what  you want.  I'm cleaning up some of the code base at the moment before I progress with any "new" features.
