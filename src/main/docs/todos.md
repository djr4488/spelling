Things I'd like to accomplish but haven't started any code for yet

Statistics
==========

 1. should be competitive, so should track statistics of the child and how the child "ranks" against
    other children nationally
	a. should not actually display other child identifiable information, just a number of how this child ranks 
	   the following categories would be nice goals
	b. rank by child by school, city, state, and nationally
	c. how did school rank over all by city, state, and nationally
	f. how did city rank over all by state and nationally
	g. how did state rank over all nationally
